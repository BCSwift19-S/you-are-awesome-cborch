import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    // Need to name this label so we can control it
    @IBOutlet weak var messageLabel: UILabel!
    
    // Happens when the view loads
    // Its a system event that apple provides and is called by iOS
    // iOS sometimes known as event driven programming where there are system events or user actions to trigger functions
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    // IBAction button
    // This function executes when the button is pressed and released
    @IBAction func showMessagePressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // Dot notation allows you to access the objects attributes
        messageLabel.text = "You Are Awesome!"
    }
    
    @IBAction func showAnotherMessagePressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        messageLabel.text = "You Are Great!"
    }
}

// 2.4 Notes
// If XCode isn't doing code completion you likely have a typo
// Unresolved identifier means XCode doesn't recgonzie what you have written as having been defined
// If you break an IBOutlet connection by just chagning the names, the program will run and then crash
// - You will end up in App Delegate.swift which means there is a broken conncetion between your code and interface builder
// - Can see a broken connection because the circle plug in will be white not black
// - RIght click on View Controller dot and break the connection. Then drag the white dot over to the label to reestablish the connection
// Use Refactor for better renaming
// - This will automatically rename it every place it appears inclduing in Outlet connections
