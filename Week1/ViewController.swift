// 2.4 Notes
// If XCode isn't doing code completion you likely have a typo
// Unresolved identifier means XCode doesn't recgonzie what you have written as having been defined
// If you break an IBOutlet connection by just chagning the names, the program will run and then crash
// - You will end up in App Delegate.swift which means there is a broken conncetion between your code and interface builder
// - Can see a broken connection because the circle plug in will be white not black
// - RIght click on View Controller dot and break the connection. Then drag the white dot over to the label to reestablish the connection
// Use Refactor for better renaming
// - This will automatically rename it every place it appears inclduing in Outlet connections

// 2.5 Notes
// XCode autocomplete will you tell you the type of thing you are accessing
// From there you can figure out how to match that type
// We looked at the UIColor type of Labels

// 2.6 Notes
// Conditional Logic(IF)
// Looking at the IF statement
// == is comparison, = is assignment

// 2.7 Notes
// Constants with let
// A value that is unchanging
// Message values only exist in their fucntion or lower
// This is known as scope
// The scope of message values is only within function so they don't exist elsewhere
// XCode won't code complete outside of scope which is awesome
// Pull them out of func for class wide scope
// Why mot define everything classwide?
// - Greater chance of error
// - Clutter, memory managment
